## Description
**Algorithm:**
- Waits for the user to choose a move with a click on one of the buttons

- On click (onclick) the computer chooses a random number(x) 0<=x <1 (Math.random()).
If the random number is included:
- 0 <= x < 1/3 pc uses 'rock' move
- 1/3 <= x <2/3 pc uses 'paper' move
- 2/3 <= x < 1 PC uses the move 'scissors'<br>

*this will determine the computer's move.*

Finally calculate the result, update the page with the new score and save the score in localStorage.
